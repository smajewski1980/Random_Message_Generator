# Codecademy Project - Random Message Generator

## Description

Here is my interpretation of the random message generator project. The user is prompted for their name, and then they recieve a personalized message consisting of a quote, what the user should eat for dinner tonight and the user's lucky number. Kinda serious, kinda silly.
